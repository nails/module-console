# Docs for `nailsapp/module-console`
> Documentation is a WIP.


This module brings a powerful, extendable console tool to Nails applications. Every module, and the application itself, can provide commands which should be run on the CLI.

This module leverages Symfony's Console component, with a little added sugar sprinkled on top.
